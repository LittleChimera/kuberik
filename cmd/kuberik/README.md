# Kuberik CLI

Kuberik CLI is built with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). If you want to extend the CLI, most documentation is available on the root page.
Most notably, please use [Cobra Generator](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/cobra/README.md) whenever you can, for creating new commands.
